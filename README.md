# Shooter Game

Welcome to Shooter Game, a digital implementation of a vintage space shooter game! In this game, your goal is to fend off unlimited waves of enemies and achieve the highest score possible. Play it [here](https://ryanlhy.github.io/shootergame/).

## How to Play

To play the game, use the arrow keys to move your spaceship and the space bar to fire at the incoming enemies. Avoid colliding with the enemies or their shots, as this will decrease your health.

As you progress through the game, the enemies will become more numerous and more difficult to defeat. Can you make it to the top of the leaderboard?

## Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript: The game logic and gameplay is implemented using plain JavaScript.
- Node.js: The game is built on top of the Node.js platform, which allows us to run JavaScript code on the server side.

## Development Notes

- The game uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to organize the code and manage the interactions between game objects.
- Collision detection is implemented using basic geometric calculations to determine when two objects overlap.
- The game is designed to be scalable and easily extensible, allowing for the addition of new enemy types and gameplay mechanics in the future.

## Future Improvements

- Add more enemy types with unique behaviors and abilities.
- Implement power-ups that the player can collect to gain temporary advantages.
- Add a high score leaderboard to track the best players.
